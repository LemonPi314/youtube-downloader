Download YouTube videos in varying resolutions and bitrates.
## Requirements
* Windows operating system
* 30 MB of free space for the executable
* 70 MB of free space for temporary files
* Internet connection
## Usage
Paste the URL of the video into the URL field, select an output folder, and click 'Get Info'. After a few seconds a list of available streams will appear. Select the streams you would like to download and click 'Download'.

Some streams have both video and audio tracks. However, some streams have only the video track or only the audio track, which will download as separate files. You can combine video and audio tracks using a tool such as [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/).  
To play some streams you will need to install a codec extension like the AV1 Video Extension from the Microsoft Store.
